# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created an app for Chada Tech software engineering company that will allow clients to view a 12-hour and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock. The functions create two (2) clocks that show simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.
The app is a C++ program that shows time in two formats: 12-hour and 24-hour. This feature enables Chada Techâ€™s international customers to view time according to their preferred time zone. Besides just showing time, the program allows users to add hours or minutes and exit the application. These features aim to engage users and enhance their time management.

# What did you do particularly well?
One of my main strengths was effectively creating the Clock class, which handled all time-related tasks. By breaking the code into smaller parts, I made it easier to maintain and read. I used functions for displaying time and getting user input, which kept the main() part of the program simple. I also focused on formatting the time clearly and attractively to enhance the user experience.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code and make improvements to make it more efficient by:
- Efficiency: To make the program faster, I could utilize more efficient algorithms for adding time, which would aid in handling more complex calculations or a larger number of users.
- Security: I should add strong input checks to stop users from entering invalid data. It would help prevent crashes and make the program more reliable.
- Readability: I could add more comments and clear documentation throughout the code to help future developers better understand it. This practice supports teamwork and knowledge sharing.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was ensuring that the time increments worked correctly, especially when adjusting seconds, minutes, and hours. I paid close attention to details to ensure proper transitions, such as rolling over from 60 seconds to a minute. I overcame these challenges by testing various scenarios to identify any issues. I also used a C++ documentation guide for help. Although I still have some challenges in the main() section of the program. Moving forward, I plan to utilize SNHU's 24/7 student tutoring, join developer communities, and attend meetups to enhance my support network.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
Some of the skills from this project that could be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework include:
- Object-Oriented Programming: I learned to design and utilize classes and methods, which is helpful for many programming tasks and helps create clear, organized code.
- Modular Design: Breaking complex problems into smaller functions proved essential. This approach enhances efficiency and clarity in software development.
- User Interaction: Creating user-friendly interfaces and managing user input are essential skills for developing interactive applications.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make the program easy to maintain, read, and adapt, I organized the code into clear functions, each focusing on a specific task. This structure helps users navigate the code easily and defines clear roles for different parts. I used consistent naming and added comments throughout the code to explain the purpose and reasoning behind each part, which improved readability. I also designed the program to be adaptable, allowing for easy addition of new features or changes in the future. This flexibility helps ensure that ongoing development can happen without affecting the quality or performance of the existing code.
